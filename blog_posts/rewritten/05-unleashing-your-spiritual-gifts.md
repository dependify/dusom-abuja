# Unleashing Your Spiritual Gifts: Discovering Your Divine Equipment

![Spiritual Gifts](/blog-images/spiritual-gifts-1.jpg)

## You Are Not Empty-Handed

Before you were born, God made a decision about your life. He looked at the challenges this generation would face, the needs that would arise, the ministry that would be required—and He packaged specific abilities inside you. **You are not empty-handed. You are divinely equipped.**

The tragedy of the modern church is not that God has stopped giving gifts—it's that His people have stopped discovering and deploying them. Too many believers are running around heaven's hardware store, begging for tools they already possess, unaware of the treasure locked within them.

> "But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all." — 1 Corinthians 12:7

## Every Believer Has at Least One Gift

Let's be clear: **Spiritual gifts are not just for pastors, prophets, and apostles.** They are for every believer who has been born again. The moment you received Christ, the Holy Spirit took up residence in your life—and He didn't come empty-handed.

Romans 12:6 tells us we have different gifts **"according to the grace given to us."** Your gifts are not earned; they are grace deposits. You didn't work for them, and you can't lose them through failure.

### The Seven Motivational Gifts (Romans 12)

These gifts shape your personality and determine how you naturally respond to life:

**1. Prophecy** - The ability to speak God's truth boldly
*Signs:* You can't stand hypocrisy, you're direct, you see things black and white

**2. Serving** - The ability to detect and meet practical needs
*Signs:* You notice what others miss, you love behind-the-scenes work, you're reliable

**3. Teaching** - The ability to explain truth clearly
*Signs:* You research thoroughly, you love systems, you ask deep questions

**4. Exhortation** - The ability to encourage and motivate
*Signs:* People feel better after talking to you, you see potential in others, you're positive

**5. Giving** - The ability to contribute resources liberally
*Signs:* You love blessing others financially, you spot needs before they're mentioned

**6. Leadership** - The ability to cast vision and organize people
*Signs:* People naturally follow you, you see the big picture, you delegate well

**7. Mercy** - The ability to empathize and relieve suffering
*Signs:* You're drawn to the hurting, you feel others' pain, you're compassionate

**Discerning of Spirits** - Ability to detect spiritual influences

## How to Discover Your Gifts

### 1. Desire Them

"Earnestly desire the best gifts" (1 Corinthians 12:31). God responds to hunger. If you want to operate in the gifts, ask Him. Desire is the doorway to discovery.

### 2. Experiment in Safe Environments

You won't discover your gifts by reading about them—you discover them by doing. Volunteer. Serve. Try different things. DUSOM provides safe environments to practice and develop your gifts under proper covering.

### 3. Pay Attention to Results

Where do you see fruit? What do others confirm in your life? When you teach, do people understand? When you give, does God multiply it? Fruit is the validation of gift.

### 4. Get Feedback

Ask mature believers: "What do you see in me? What stands out when I serve?" Sometimes others see our gifts before we do. Don't be afraid to ask.

### 5. Study the Word

The more you understand the gifts, the more you'll recognize them operating in your life. Study 1 Corinthians 12-14, Romans 12, and Ephesians 4.

## Fan Your Gift Into Flame

Paul told Timothy: *"Stir up the gift of God which is in you"* (2 Timothy 1:6). The word "stir up" means to fan into flame. Gifts can lie dormant, like embers needing oxygen.

**How to fan your gifts into flame:**

**Use Them Regularly**
Gifts grow through exercise. A gift used occasionally stays weak; a gift used frequently becomes powerful. Don't wait for a platform—use your gift wherever you are.

**Associate with Fire**
Fire spreads. If you want your gift to burn hotter, spend time with people whose gifts are already flaming. Their fire will ignite yours.

**Remove the Ash**
Ash smothers fire. What ash is covering your gift? Fear? Insecurity? Past failures? Unforgiveness? Remove the ash so your gift can breathe.

**Add Fuel**
Prayer, fasting, worship, and the Word are fuel for your gifts. The more fuel you add, the hotter your gifts burn.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Comparing Your Gift to Others

Your gift is unique because you are unique. Comparing your gift to someone else's is like comparing apples to oranges—they're both fruit, but different by design.

### Mistake 2: Trying to Earn Your Gift

Gifts are grace, not wages. You can't earn what you've already been given. Stop striving and start receiving.

### Mistake 3: Hiding Your Gift

The servant who buried his talent wasn't punished for failing—he was punished for not trying. Use your gift, even if imperfectly. God multiplies what we use, not what we hide.

### Mistake 4: Operating Without Love

1 Corinthians 13 makes it clear: gifts without love are noise. The goal of gifts is not impressive display—it's edification through love.

## Your Gifts Are for Others

"Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others" (1 Peter 4:10). Your gifts are not for your ego—they're for others' edification. The gift you neglect is the blessing someone else is missing.

That person who needs encouragement? Your gift of exhortation is their answer. That confused believer? Your teaching gift can bring clarity. That sick person? Your healing gift can release miracle.

**The world is waiting for your gifts to be unleashed.**

## Activation Prayer

*Holy Spirit, thank You for the gifts You've placed in my life. I refuse to let them lie dormant any longer. I stir them up right now by faith. I fan them into flame through use and practice.

I come against every spirit of fear, intimidation, and inadequacy that would keep me from operating in my gifts. I declare that I am fearfully and wonderfully made, equipped by heaven for supernatural service.

Show me my gifts, Lord. Confirm them through results and the witness of others. Give me opportunities to use them. Surround me with people who will fan my flame.

I will not bury my talent. I will not compare my gift. I will not let fear stop me. I unleash my spiritual gifts for the glory of God and the edification of His people.

Let your gifts flow through me like rivers of living water. In Jesus' mighty name, Amen!*
