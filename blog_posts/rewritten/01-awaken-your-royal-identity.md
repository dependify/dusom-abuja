# Awaken Your Royal Identity: Reigning in Life Through Christ

![Royal Crown](/blog-images/royal-identity-1.jpg)

## A Personal Invitation to Royalty

Beloved child of God, pause for a moment and breathe in this truth: **You were never designed to live an ordinary life.** The Creator of the universe has placed within you a spark of divine royalty, a calling that transcends your current circumstances and launches you into realms of extraordinary impact.

Have you ever felt that stirring in your spirit—that deep knowing that there must be more to this Christian journey than Sunday services and routine prayers? That stirring is your royal DNA calling out, reminding you of who you truly are in Christ.

> "But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people..." — 1 Peter 2:9

## The Awakening: Discovering Your True Nature

### When God Said "Let Us Make Man..."

Picture this: The Trinity gathered in counsel before the foundation of the world, their hearts overflowing with love and purpose. The Father speaks with divine excitement, *"Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion..."* (Genesis 1:26)

This was not a casual suggestion—it was a royal decree! When God breathed His breath into Adam, He wasn't just creating another creature; He was crowning a king. The Hebrew word for *"dominion"* is **radah**, which means to tread down, to rule, to take precedence. This is the language of kings!

**Pause and Reflect:** 
- What areas of your life have you been allowing to "tread down" on you instead of you taking dominion?
- Where have you settled for less than what God intended for you?

### The Crown Awaits: Living from Victory, Not for Victory

Listen carefully, beloved: **Your royal identity is not something you're striving to achieve—it's who you already are.** The moment you received Christ, you were transferred from the kingdom of darkness into the Kingdom of light, from slavery to sonship, from poverty to royal inheritance.

The psalmist declared with wonder: *"What is man that You are mindful of him... For You have made him a little lower than the angels, and You have crowned him with glory and honor."* (Psalm 8:4-5)

That crown is not waiting for you in heaven—it's on your head right now! Every challenge you face, every mountain you encounter, every circumstance that rises against you must bow to the crown of glory that adorns your life.

### Prayer of Awakening

*Heavenly Father, open the eyes of my understanding. Let the revelation of my royal identity flood my soul like never before. I refuse to live beneath my privilege any longer. I choose to arise and shine, for my light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon me. In Jesus' mighty name, Amen!*

## The Seven Pillars of Your Royal Reign

### 1. **Authority: Speak and It Shall Be Established**

Kings don't beg—they decree. When a king speaks, creation rearranges itself to align with his words. This is your heritage in Christ! Job 22:28 declares: *"You will also decree a thing, and it will be established for you."*

**Practical Activation:**
- Begin each morning by decreeing God's promises over your life
- When challenges arise, open your mouth and speak God's Word with authority
- Stop pleading with circumstances and start commanding them to align with heaven

> "Death and life are in the power of the tongue..." — Proverbs 18:21

### 2. **Prosperity: The King's Resources**

Royalty and poverty cannot coexist in God's economy. Abraham, the father of faith, was so wealthy that kings sought alliances with him. This same Abrahamic blessing flows through your veins today!

But hear this: Divine prosperity is not merely about bank balances—it's about having **more than enough** to fulfill your divine assignment. It's about being a conduit of blessing, not a reservoir.

*2 Corinthians 9:8 promises: "And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every good work."*

### 3. **Favor: The Royal Welcome**

When royalty enters a room, doors open without knocking. This is the favor of God working in your life! Psalm 5:12 declares: *"You, O Lord, will bless the righteous; with favor You will surround him as with a shield."*

Favor will cause people to champion your cause, opportunities to find you, and barriers to dissolve before you. It's not about your education, your connections, or your abilities—it's about the crown you carry!

### 4. **Dignity: Carrying Yourself Like the King's Kid**

There's something about royalty that commands respect without demanding it. It's the way they carry themselves—their posture, their speech, their confidence. As a child of the Most High, you carry the dignity of heaven.

This doesn't mean arrogance; it means **holy confidence**. You are the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus. You are the head and not the tail, above only and not beneath. Let your life reflect this reality!

### 5. **Quality: Excellence is Your Standard**

Kings don't settle for mediocrity. Daniel refused to defile himself with the king's portion because he understood that royalty demands excellence. When you offer your service, your work, your worship—give your best. This is the hallmark of those who carry divine royalty.

### 6. **Security: Untouchable by Divine Decree**

The blood of Jesus has made you untouchable by the enemy! Just as the blood on the doorposts in Egypt caused death to pass over the Israelites, the blood of the Lamb marks you as protected, preserved, and untouchable.

Walk in this security. No weapon formed against you shall prosper. The enemy cannot touch what God has anointed!

### 7. **Righteousness: The Foundation of True Royalty**

All true royalty is founded on righteousness. Psalm 45:6 tells us: *"Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your Kingdom."*

Your right standing with God is not based on your performance—it's based on Christ's finished work. Rest in this, and let righteousness flow through every area of your life.

## Your Daily Royal Decree

Begin each day with this powerful declaration:

*"I am a child of the Most High God, crowned with glory and honor. I carry the authority of heaven in my words. I walk in divine prosperity and supernatural favor. I am surrounded by God's protection and sealed by His blood. Today, I reign in life through Christ Jesus! Every circumstance, every challenge, every obstacle bows to my royal authority. I am more than a conqueror. I am royalty!"*

## Call to Action: Step Into Your Throne

1. **Meditate on Your Identity:** Spend time this week in Psalm 8, 1 Peter 2, and Revelation 1. Let the Holy Spirit engrave your royal identity deep into your spirit.

2. **Practice Your Authority:** Start small. Speak to situations in your life with the authority of a king. Command peace into chaos, healing into sickness, provision into lack.

3. **Walk in Dignity:** Carry yourself like the royalty you are. Let your words, your dress, your conduct reflect your heavenly citizenship.

4. **Join the Royal Academy:** If you're hungry to learn more about walking in your royal destiny, consider joining DUSOM's upcoming School of Ministry. Here, you'll be equipped to reign in every area of life.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How is this different from the prosperity gospel?**

A: This teaching is not about materialism or selfish gain. It's about understanding your position in Christ and stewarding it for Kingdom impact. True royal prosperity is about having enough to be a blessing, not hoarding for yourself.

**Q: Can I really "decree" things as a believer?**

A: Absolutely! When you speak God's Word in faith, you are releasing divine authority. This is not about magic words—it's about aligning your words with heaven's reality and watching earth conform.

**Q: What if I don't feel like royalty?**

A: Feelings follow facts, not the other way around. Your identity is not based on how you feel but on what God has declared. As you meditate on these truths, your feelings will align with your reality.

**Q: How does this apply to someone struggling financially or in difficult circumstances?**

A: Your current circumstances do not define your identity. Many biblical heroes faced hardship while carrying royal promises. Your situation is temporary; your identity is eternal. Start declaring your royal identity over your circumstances and watch transformation unfold.
