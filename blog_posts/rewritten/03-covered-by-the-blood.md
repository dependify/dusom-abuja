# Covered by the Blood: The Power of Divine Preservation

![Blood Covenant Protection](/blog-images/blood-covenant-1.jpg)

## The Scarlet Thread of Redemption

From the very first pages of Scripture to the triumphant finale of Revelation, one theme weaves through every chapter like a scarlet thread—the power of the blood. It's the story of a God who would rather shed His own blood than lose His beloved children. It's the chronicle of a divine exchange: His life for ours, His death for our life, His brokenness for our wholeness.

Tonight, I invite you on a journey through time and eternity. We're going to trace the blood-marked path of God's preserving power—from Eden's first sacrifice to Calvary's ultimate offering, and into your life today.

> "And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you..." — Exodus 12:13

## When God Sees the Blood

There's something mysterious, something almost incomprehensible, about the power God has invested in blood. Leviticus 17:11 declares: *"For the life of the flesh is in the blood... it is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul."*

When God sees the blood, something shifts in the spiritual realm. Judgment is stayed. Mercy is released. Protection is activated. And this isn't just Old Testament theology—this is your present-day reality in Christ.

**The blood of Jesus is speaking right now on your behalf.** Can you hear it? It's speaking better things than Abel's blood. It's declaring mercy where judgment should fall. It's establishing a covenant that hell itself cannot break.

## The Preservation Chronicles: Evidence Through History

### Chapter 1: The First Covering (Genesis 3:21)

Imagine the scene: Adam and Eve, trembling in shame among the fig leaves, hearing the footsteps of God approaching. They had disobeyed. Death had been pronounced. The future seemed hopeless.

But then—mercy!

"Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them."

Did you catch it? **Skins imply death.** An innocent animal gave its life so Adam and Eve could be covered. This was the first blood sacrifice, the first prophetic whisper of a Lamb who would one day give His life to cover all humanity.

From the very beginning, God established the pattern: **Blood covers. Blood preserves. Blood protects.**

### Chapter 2: The Scarlet Cord of Salvation (Joshua 2)

Rahab was a woman with a past. Living on the wall of Jericho, she had heard the stories of Israel's God—and faith had been birthed in her heart. When the spies came, she hid them. When their lives were in danger, she lowered them down by a scarlet cord.

That red rope wasn't just an escape route—it was a prophetic symbol. It marked her house for salvation when judgment fell on Jericho. The walls fell, the city was destroyed, but Rahab's house **remained standing** because of the scarlet thread.

**The blood-marked house is an indestructible house.**

What are you marking with the blood of Jesus today? Your home? Your family? Your business? Your health? Mark it boldly! The enemy cannot touch what the blood has covered.

### Chapter 3: The Blood That Stopped the Plague (2 Samuel 24)

David had sinned. Pride had led him to number Israel, trusting in military might rather than in God. The consequence was devastating—a plague that claimed 70,000 lives.

But watch the mercy of God in action. The prophet Gad instructed David to build an altar on the threshing floor of Araunah and offer a sacrifice. As soon as the blood was shed, **the plague stopped.**

The blood sacrifice became a transaction of mercy. David's repentance, combined with the shed blood, turned away the wrath of God and established peace.

What plague is threatening your life today? What destruction has the enemy unleashed against your family, your finances, your health? The blood of Jesus is still the answer! It has power to stop every plague, arrest every destruction, and turn every curse into blessing.

### Chapter 4: The Unparalleled Power of Jesus' Blood

Every sacrifice we've mentioned—every animal, every offering—was merely a shadow. The substance, the reality, the fulfillment of them all is found in **the blood of Jesus.**

Listen to these life-changing truths about the blood:

**1. The Blood Ransoms**

Jesus declared: *"The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many."* (Matthew 20:28)

A ransom is a price paid to free a captive. You were held hostage by sin, by death, by the powers of darkness. Jesus paid the ultimate price—His own precious blood—to set you free. You are not for sale anymore. You belong to God!

**2. The Blood Transmits Life**

*"For the life of the flesh is in the blood..."* (Leviticus 17:11)

When you partake of communion—when you receive the body and blood of Christ by faith—you are not performing a ritual. You are **receiving life.** Divine, indestructible, resurrection life flows into your mortal body. Sickness cannot remain where this life enters. Death flees before its presence.

**3. The Blood Is a Weapon**

*"And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony..."* (Revelation 12:11)

The blood is not passive—it is a weapon of war! When you plead the blood of Jesus over your life, your family, your circumstances, you are releasing divine ammunition against the kingdom of darkness. Demons tremble. Strongholds crumble. The enemy's plans are dismantled.

**4. The Blood Speaks**

*"...to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel."* (Hebrews 12:24)

Abel's blood cried out for vengeance from the ground. Jesus' blood cries out for mercy, for forgiveness, for protection, for blessing. Right now, as you read these words, the blood is speaking over you—declaring you forgiven, healed, protected, and blessed!

**5. The Blood Channels Blessing**

*"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?"* (1 Corinthians 10:16)

The cup of blessing is connected to the blood. Isaiah 65:8 tells us that the blessing prevents destruction. When you are under the blood, you are under an open heaven of blessing that prevents every form of destruction from touching your life.

## How to Engage the Blood for Your Preservation

Knowing about the blood is not enough—we must learn to engage it actively. Here are three practical ways:

### 1. **Through the Communion Table**

Don't treat communion as a religious ritual. Approach it as a **divine transaction**. When you hold the bread and the cup, let faith arise in your heart. Declare:

*"As I eat this bread and drink this cup, I am receiving the body broken for me and the blood shed for me. I am taking into my being divine life, divine health, divine protection. Every plague, every curse, every evil is passing over me because I am covered by the blood!"*

### 2. **By Faith Declarations**

Your mouth is a powerful instrument. Use it to release the power of the blood:

- *"I plead the blood of Jesus over my life and family."*
- *"I cover my home, my business, my health with the blood of Jesus."*
- *"No weapon formed against me shall prosper because I am blood-bought, blood-washed, and blood-covered!"*

### 3. **As Led by the Spirit**

Romans 8:14 says: *"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God."*

There will be times when the Holy Spirit prompts you to do something specific—perhaps to anoint your doorposts with oil as an act of faith, or to take communion at an unusual time, or to declare the blood over a specific situation. Be sensitive and obey. These Spirit-led actions release extraordinary protection.

## A Prophetic Declaration Over Your Life

Right now, wherever you are, I want you to receive this word with faith:

*In the name of Jesus, I declare over your life that the preserving power of the blood is activated! Every plan of the enemy against you is thwarted. Every arrow of destruction is turned back. You and your household are marked for preservation.

You shall fulfill your days. You shall complete your assignment. Those who pursue you to destroy you shall experience their own destruction. The blood of Jesus speaks mercy, protection, and blessing over every area of your life.

You are covered. You are protected. You are preserved. In Jesus' mighty name!*

## Your Response: Walk in Confidence

Walk in this confidence. Face every challenge with boldness. Live each day knowing that you are untouchable by the powers of darkness because the blood has marked you as God's own.
