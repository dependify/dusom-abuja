<section>Preservation by the Blood Sacrifice. This concept, deeply rooted in scripture, reveals a powerful truth about God&#8217;s provision for our protection and well-being. As we explore Exodus 12:13, &#8220;And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you. And the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt,&#8221; we uncover the profound implications of the blood&#8217;s preserving power. Throughout history, the blood has been a symbol of life, sacrifice, and redemption. Our objective tonight is twofold: first, to understand the preservation power inherent in the blood; and second, to grasp how we can actively engage the blood for our own preservation. Leviticus 17:11 says, &#8220;It is the blood that makes an atonement for the soul&#8221;.Join me as we journey through biblical examples, practical applications, and spiritual insights to unlock the protective covering that the blood sacrifice offers. We will see how this ancient practice is relevant to our lives today, and how it can be a source of strength, security, and victory in the face of life&#8217;s challenges. May our hearts be open to receive the fullness of this truth, and may we be empowered to walk in the preserving power of the blood.</section>

<h2>The Preservation of Adam and Eve</h2>
<p>Our first example takes us to the very beginning, in the Garden of Eden. After Adam and Eve sinned, God declared that they would surely die. Yet, in Genesis 3:21, we see a remarkable act of mercy: &#8220;Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.&#8221; God sacrificed an animal, shedding its blood, to cover their nakedness and, I believe, to shield them from the immediate, full consequences of their sin. This act foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, whose blood covers our sins and protects us from eternal death.</p>
<p>This sets the precedent for understanding the blood sacrifice as a means of preservation. Check out this article on <a href="#">Understanding Sin and Redemption</a> for more context.</p>

<h2>Joseph&#8217;s Preservation from His Brothers</h2>
<p>Next, we see the preservation of Joseph from the murderous plot of his brothers. In Genesis 37, Joseph&#8217;s brothers, fueled by jealousy, conspired to kill him. However, they ultimately decided to dip his coat in the blood of a goat and present it to their father, Jacob, as evidence of Joseph&#8217;s supposed death. Unbeknownst to them, this act, as recorded in Genesis 37:31-34, was a divine orchestration. The blood on the coat served as a symbolic barrier, protecting Joseph from premature death. Even through the trials he faced in Egypt, Joseph was preserved because of this seemingly insignificant act of blood sacrifice.</p>
<p>This story demonstrates that God can use even the seemingly negative actions of others to fulfill His purposes. This is similar to the concept discussed in our article about <a href="#">God&#8217;s Sovereignty in Suffering</a>.</p>

<h2>Rahab and the Scarlet Cord</h2>
<p>The story of Rahab the harlot in Joshua 2:15-19 offers another powerful illustration. When Israelite spies entered Jericho, Rahab hid them and helped them escape. She lowered them down from her window using a scarlet cord, a rope that was blood-colored, symbolic of the blood. This cord not only facilitated their escape but also became a sign of salvation for Rahab and her family. When the walls of Jericho fell, the section where Rahab&#8217;s house stood, marked by the scarlet cord, remained intact. As the pastor said, &#8220;That we have come to position our lives. Both you, your family, your father&#8217;s house, I declare you are preserved.&#8221; The bloodline preserved them from destruction.</p>
<p>This powerful story highlights the importance of faith and obedience in the face of danger. To learn more, see our blog post on <a href="#">Faith in Action</a>.</p>

<h2>Samson&#8217;s Parents and the Angel&#8217;s Visit</h2>
<p>In Judges 13:22, we find the parents of Samson fearing for their lives after encountering an angel. Manoah, Samson&#8217;s father, exclaimed, &#8220;We shall surely die because we have seen God.&#8221; However, his wife wisely reasoned that if God intended to kill them, He wouldn&#8217;t have accepted their burnt offering, which involved the shedding of a kid&#8217;s blood. The blood sacrifice, in essence, closed the door to any possibility of death. It served as a powerful intercessor, demonstrating that the shedding of blood can avert divine judgment.</p>

<h2>Samuel, the Army of Israel, and the Philistines</h2>
<p>First Samuel 7:7-12 recounts how Samuel interceded for Israel during a battle against the Philistines. As the Philistines advanced, Samuel offered a suckling lamb as a burnt offering to the Lord. The Bible says, &#8220;And Samuel cried unto the Lord for Israel; and the Lord heard him.&#8221; As the sacrifice was being made, God intervened, causing a great thunderstorm that discomfited the Philistines, leading to Israel&#8217;s victory. The blood sacrifice not only secured their preservation but also brought judgment upon their enemies. The pastor powerfully declared, &#8220;The blood of Jesus is not only going to preserve you, it&#8217;s now going to cause occasion judgment in the camp of the wicked.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Samuel&#8217;s Preservation in Jesse&#8217;s House</h2>
<p>In 1 Samuel 16:1-5, God instructed Samuel to anoint a new king from among Jesse&#8217;s sons. Samuel feared that Saul, the current king, would kill him if he learned of this. God&#8217;s solution was ingenious: He told Samuel to take a heifer and say he was going to offer a sacrifice. This seemingly deceptive act was a prophetic action with several layers of meaning. It set the stage for divine operation, prepared the ground for cleansing, and most importantly, guaranteed Samuel&#8217;s preservation from Saul&#8217;s wrath. The blood sacrifice acted as a shield, ensuring Samuel&#8217;s safety as he fulfilled God&#8217;s command.</p>

<h2>David&#8217;s Blood Sacrifice for Israel&#8217;s Preservation</h2>
<p>In 2 Samuel 24, David sinned by numbering Israel, essentially placing his trust in military might rather than in God. As a consequence, a plague struck Israel, killing 70,000 people. To stop the plague, David was instructed to build an altar and offer a sacrifice on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. As soon as the sacrifice was offered, the plague ceased. This demonstrates the power of the blood to appease God&#8217;s wrath and bring about restoration. The blood sacrifice acted as a mediator, stopping the destruction and restoring peace.</p>
<p>This powerful story reminds us of the consequences of sin and the importance of repentance. See our blog post on <a href="#">Repentance and Restoration</a>.</p>

<h2>The Moabites Victory Over Jehoshaphat&#8217;s Army</h2>
<p>In 2 Kings 3, a coalition of Israel, Judah, and Edom went to war against Moab. Despite receiving a prophetic word of victory from Elisha, the tide turned when the king of Moab offered his eldest son as a burnt offering on the wall. This act of human sacrifice, though abhorrent, had a profound effect. The Bible says, &#8220;And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.&#8221; (2 Kings 3:27). God, who had promised victory, withdrew His support because the sacrifice reminded Him of the future sacrifice of His own Son. This demonstrates the unparalleled power of a blood sacrifice to alter even a divinely ordained outcome.</p>
<p>The pastor&#8217;s words resonate here: &#8220;If the word of God, the verdict of God, the decree of God, can be set aside by the power of the blood sacrifice of a human being, how much more shall the decree of a witch, a wizard, be set aside by the sacrifice of the blood of Jesus.&#8221;</p>

<h2>How the Blood Preserves</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>The Blood as a Ransom:</b> The blood serves as a ransom, a price paid to redeem us from the penalty of sin. Just as the sacrificial animals took the place of humans in the Old Testament, Jesus&#8217; blood paid the ultimate price for our sins. (Matthew 20:28, Mark 10:45, 1 Timothy 2:5-6)</li>
<li><b>The Blood Transmits Life:</b> Leviticus 17:11 states, &#8220;For the life of the flesh is in the blood.&#8221; When we partake in the communion, we are symbolically drinking the blood of Jesus, receiving His life into us. This is a life that is eternal, indestructible, and victorious over sin and death. (John 6:53-57)</li>
<li><b>The Blood as a Weapon:</b> Revelation 12:11 declares that believers overcome Satan &#8220;by the blood of the Lamb.&#8221; The blood is not just a passive symbol; it is an active weapon of defense and attack against the forces of darkness. When we plead the blood of Jesus, we are invoking its power to protect us and defeat our enemies. (Exodus 12:12-13, Zechariah 9:11-12)</li>
<li><b>The Blood Speaks:</b> The blood has a voice. In Genesis 4:10, God said that Abel&#8217;s blood cried out from the ground. Hebrews 12:24 speaks of &#8220;the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel.&#8221; Jesus&#8217; blood speaks mercy, forgiveness, and preservation over our lives.</li>
<li><b>The Blood as a Channel of Blessing:</b> 1 Corinthians 10:16 calls the communion cup &#8220;the cup of blessing.&#8221; The blessing, as described in Isaiah 65:8, prevents destruction. Therefore, partaking in the communion, engaging with the blood, connects us to the blessing that preserves and protects us from harm. The blessing is also the antidote to any curse. (Galatians 3:13)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Engaging the Blood for Preservation</h2>
<p>Now that we understand what is in the blood and how it preserves, how do we practically engage it in our daily lives?</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Through the Communion Table:</b> As stated in 1 Corinthians 10:16, the communion table is where we encounter the blood of Jesus. Partaking in communion is not merely a ritual but a powerful spiritual act where we receive the benefits of the blood.</li>
<li><b>By Declarations of Faith:</b> Revelation 12:11 also mentions that we overcome by &#8220;the word of our testimony.&#8221; We must actively declare the power of the blood over our lives, families, and situations. Just as we confess healing by His stripes, we can declare protection and victory by the blood.</li>
<li><b>As Led by the Spirit:</b> Romans 8:14 says, &#8220;For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.&#8221; There may be times when the Holy Spirit prompts us to engage the blood in specific ways, such as anointing with oil or applying the communion elements in a particular situation. We must be sensitive to His guidance.</li>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Beloved, the message of preservation by the blood sacrifice is not a relic of the past but a present reality for every believer. As we&#8217;ve journeyed through these biblical examples, we&#8217;ve seen how God consistently used the blood to protect, deliver, and provide for His people. From Adam and Eve to the Israelites in Egypt, from Rahab to Samuel, and ultimately to the sacrifice of Jesus, the blood has been a powerful symbol and instrument of God&#8217;s grace. We have seen that the blood is not just a symbol but a spiritual reality that carries life, power, and the very presence of God. The blood serves as our ransom, it transmits the life of Christ into us, it acts as a weapon against the enemy, it speaks on our behalf, and it channels the blessing that preserves us from destruction.</p>
<p>Let us embrace the power of the blood in our lives. Let us partake in communion with reverence and faith, actively declare the blood&#8217;s power over our circumstances, and remain sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit. The pastor&#8217;s words echo in my heart: &#8220;You shall fulfill your days. Those pursuing you to destroy you, they shall experience their destruction.&#8221; As we engage the blood, we can walk in confidence, knowing that we are protected, preserved, and empowered to fulfill our God-given destinies. May we never forget the profound significance of the blood sacrifice and its ongoing relevance in our lives. May we live each day under the banner of the blood, experiencing its preserving power and walking in victory. Amen.</p>
